        <h1><br>Projects</h1>
        <p>Throughout the classes I have taken I have accumulated a decent portfolio of projects that I keep regularly updated on Github.</p>

        <h1><br>Operating Systems</h1>
        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>
            More than ten years of experience using and installing Windows operating systems from Windows XP to Windows 10.
            I have been using Windows since I first used a computer. My time spent using Windows has equipped me to diagnose and solve
            any problems that may arise due to anything from hardware failure to malware. If I sit in front of a Windows machine I 
            am immediately at home.
        </p>
        <h3><br>Mac OS</h3>
        <p>
            While I am primarily a Windows and Linux user I have also spent countless hours learning about and using Mac OS.
            My knowledge regarding Mac OS comes from installing Mac OS onto incompatible hardware. This is known as a "hackintosh"
            and it has been invaluable in my efforts to learn about Apple's operating system and how it differs from Windows or Linux.
            A hackintosh can take many hours to troubleshoot in order to simply achieve a stable installation so I am confident in saying
            that I am more than comfortable working on and troubleshooting Macs.
        </p>
        <h3><br>Linux</h3>
        <p>
            While my desktop dual boots Windows and Linux my personal laptop runs solely on Arch Linux. I did this a few years ago
            in order to force myself to get used to working in an unfamiliar operating system. I can say that I am now comfortable working
            on a linux machine and it is now my preferred operating system to program with. I can work with both Debian-based distribution
            like Ubuntu or Kali and also any arch-based distribution like Manjaro or Arch of course.
