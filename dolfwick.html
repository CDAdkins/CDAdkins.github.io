        <h1>Dolfwick</h1>
        <p>Dolfwick was a film group that I was a part of for a high school film class. We didn't make good movies, but at least we had fun.</p>

        <h3><em>Citizen Kevin</em></h3>
        <p>
            This is a "silent" film since we weren't allowed to use microphones yet. The film is too long and the story is poorly explained.
            It has its moments but I wouldn't watch this one first.<br><br><br>

        <h3><em>Say No</em></h3>
        <p>
            Another psuedo silent film, <em>Say No</em> is a music video that tells the story of a teenager who gets picked on at school.
            This one is much shorter and simpler to follow. You might even enjoy yourself a little bit.<br><br><br>

        <h3><em>Minnesota Thomas</em></h3>
        <p>
            Our first film with dialogue, <em>Minnesota Thomas</em> is an Indiana Jones parody wherein a young student must secure an ancient Nazi treasure.<br><br><br>

        <h3><em>The Delivery</em></h3>
        <p>
            My personal favorite, <em>The Delivery</em> is a horror-comedy that follows a group of friends and their encounter with a dangerous pizza company.<br><br><br>

        <h3><em>The Rookie</em></h3>
        <p>
            They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but this film was. <em>The Rookie</em>
            is a COPS parody which follows a suspicious cop and his new partner as they try to take down a notorious "Rock, Paper, Scissors" champion.<br><br><br>
