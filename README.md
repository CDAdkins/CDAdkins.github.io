Just a website I use to showcase some of the projects I've made using the nature of code series on YouTube by Daniel Shiffman. I have a tool that I used at uBreakiFix to facilitate easy completion of the required trainings that has some bugs but will usually get the job done. It also includes some (outdated) information about me. Mostly the website is what I use to learn about web development and making my projects more easy to share with others.
