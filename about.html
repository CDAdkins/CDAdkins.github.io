        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Chris Adkins. I am a 21 year old Computer Science student at Miracosta College in Oceanside, CA. I am a 
            "Computer Guy" through and through. I enjoy building computers as well as fixing computers that need help. Whether the problem is with
            hardware or software I will usually be able to diagnose the problem and create a plan to fix it as quickly and efficiently as possible.
